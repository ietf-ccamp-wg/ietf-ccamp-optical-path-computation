Therefore I think a better strategy is to combine these two and have a common path computation model for both flex grid and wson. We can add flex-grid- or wson-specific constructs onto the common model using augments (or even within the same model by switch-case statement) if there is a need.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss this comment in the context of issue #9 since this has an impact on the number of documents that we should progress for optical path computation",
