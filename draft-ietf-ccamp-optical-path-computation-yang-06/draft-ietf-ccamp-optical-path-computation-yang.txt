YANG Data Models for requesting Path Computation in WDM Optical Networks
         draft-ietf-ccamp-optical-path-computation-yang-latest

Abstract

   This document provides a mechanism to request path computation in
   Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical networks composed of
   Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON) and Flexi-Grid Dense
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) switched technologies.  This
   model augments the Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) defined in RFC YYYY.

   [RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of
   draft-ietf-teas-yang-path-computation once it has been published.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] describes key use cases, where
   a client needs to request underlying Software-Defined Network (SDN)
   controllers for path computation.  In some of these use cases, the
   underlying SDN controller can control a single-layer optical
   technologies, including Optical Transport Network (OTN), Wavelength
   Switched Optical Networks (WSON), Flexi-grid, and multi-layer Optical
   network.

   This document defines YANG data models, which augment the generic
   Path Computation RPC defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation], with technology-specific
   augmentations required to request path computation to an underlying
   Optical SDN controller.  These models allow a client to delegate path
   computation tasks to the underlying Optical SDN controller without
   having to obtain optical-layer information from the controller and
   performing feasible path computation itself.  This is especially
   helpful in cases where computing optically-feasible paths require
   knowledge of physical-layer states, such as optical impairments,
   which are visible only to the Optical controller.

1.1.  Terminology and Notations

   Refer to [RFC7446] and [RFC7581] for the key terms used in this
   document.  The following terms are defined in [RFC7950] and are not
   redefined here:

   *  client

   *  server

   *  augment

   *  data model

   *  data node

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  configuration data

   *  state data

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC7950].

1.2.  Tree Diagram

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   Section 3 of this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these
   diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

1.3.  Prefix in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG imported modules, as shown in Table 1.

2.  YANG Data Models for WDM Path Computation

2.1.  YANG Models Overview

   The YANG data models for requesting WDM path computation are defined
   as augmentations of the generic Path Computation RPC defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation], as shown in Figure 1.

     Figure 1: Relationship between WDM and TE path computation models

   The entities and Traffic Engineering (TE) attributes, such as
   requested path and tunnel attributes, defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation], are still applicable when
   requesting WDM path computation and the models defined in this
   document only specifies the additional technology-specific
   attributes/information, using the attributes defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

2.2.  Attributes Augmentation

   The common characteristics for layer 0 (WSON and Flexi-grid) path
   computation are under definition in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis] and
   re-used in the ietf-wdm-path-computation YANG models.

2.3.  Bandwidth Augmentation

   As described in Section 4.2 of [RFC7699], there is some overlap
   between bandwidth and label in layer0.

   The WSON and flexi-grid label resource information described in
   Section 2.4, is sufficient to describe also the spectrum resources
   within WSON and flexi-grid networks.  Therefore, the model does not
   define any augmentation for the te-bandwidth containers defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation].

2.4.  Label Augmentations

   The models augment all the occurrences of the label-restriction list
   with WSON and Flexi-grid technology-specific attributes using the l0-
   label-range-info and flexi-grid-label-range-info groupings defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

   Moreover, the models augment all the occurrences of the te-label
   container with the WSON, Flexi-grid and OTN technology-specific
   attributes using the wson-label-start-end, wson-label-hop, wson-
   label-step, flexi-grid-label-start-end, flexi-grid-label-hop and
   flexi-grid-label-step defined in [I-D.ietf-ccamp-rfc9093-bis].

                 Figure 3: WDM path computation YANG module

5.  Manageability Considerations

   This document provides a method for requesting path computations for
   WSON and Flexi-Grid tunnels.  Consideration of mechanisms to gather
   and collate information required for the path computations will be
   necessary.  Furthermore, storing path computation requests and
   responses and triggering actions will also need to be carefully
   managed and secured.

   Future versions of this document will contain additional information.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document will be accessed via the
   NETCONF protocol [RFC6241] or RESTCONF protocol [RFC8040].  The
   lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access to particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a pre-configured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   Some of the RPC operations defined in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus essential to control access to these operations.

   Operations defined in this document, and their sensitivities and
   possible vulnerabilities, will be discussed further in future
   versions of this document.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following URIs in the "ns" subregistry
   within the "IETF XML registry" [RFC3688].

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-wdm-path-computation
     Registrant Contact:  The IESG.
     XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC7950].

     name:      ietf-wdm-path-computation
     namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-wson-path-computation
     prefix:    wdm-pc

Appendix A.  Change Log

   The initial YANG data model requesting path computation in optical
   networks was draft-gbb-ccamp-optical-path-computation-yang-00.  This
   document included path computation request capabilities for WSON,
   Flexi-Grid and OTN technologies.  However, it was proposed at IETF
   113 (March 25, 2022) to split the initial document into separate
   documents for WDM (WSON and Flexi-Grid) and OTN technologies, as each
   technology may be developed and implemented separately.

   The WDM technology capabilities were kept in this document, and the
   OTN capabilities were moved into
   [I-D.draft-gbb-ccamp-otn-path-computation-yang].

   Editors note, please remove this appendix before publication.
